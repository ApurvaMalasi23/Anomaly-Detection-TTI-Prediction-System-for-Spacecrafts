# Anomaly-Detection-TTI-Prediction-System-for-Spacecrafts
Designed a TinyML-based anomaly detection system using LSTM Autoencoders to identify faults in spacecraft telemetry data and an LSTM Regressor to predict Time-To-Intervention (TTI). Built a priority queue mechanism to rank anomalies and transmit real-time alerts to ground control, optimized for resource-constrained hardware.
